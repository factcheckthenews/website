      <h1>About this Project</h1>
      <p>Fact Check the News is a project with the goal of encouraging people to practice critical thinking when consuming information on the Internet. This project is open source to allow for both transparency and open discourse on the <a href="https://github.com/factcheckthenews/heuristics/blob/master/docs/SCORING.md">scoring criteria</a>.</p>

      <h3>Addressing "Fake News"</h3>

      <p>Prior to the Internet, unethical news spread in printed media for hundreds of years. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_journalism">Yellow journalism</a> refers to a standard of reporting devoid of morals and professional ethics.
      
      During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age">Gilded Age</a>, unethical journalists would engage in fraud by fabricating stories, interviews, and made-up names for scholars out of whole cloth.</p>
      
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news_website">Fake news websites</a> deliberately publish hoaxes, propaganda, and disinformation, using social media to drive web traffic and amplify their effect. Social networks and search engines give us instant access to information, but there is little guarantee that the information we find is true.</p>

      <p>This project is still in its infancy, but the immediate goal is to mitigate the spread of false information on the Internet.</p>
